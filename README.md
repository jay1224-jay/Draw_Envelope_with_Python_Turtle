# Draw Envelope with Python & Python Turtle

**NOTE: This project is for Taiwan Academic Portfolio / E-Portfolio. Please do not crib it.**

## Currently Working on [__*2023-01-25 automatically execute*__](https://github.com/jay1224-jay/research-of-envelope-with-python/tree/main/2023-01-25%20automatically%20execute) !!!

## What is **"Envelope"** in Math?

Use some tangent lines to draw the shape by the pattern you use.
For example, if the pattern is *n -> 2n*, then you will get the heart shape.

## What does this project do?

Illustrate shapes from kinds of patterns such as *n -> n^2*, *n -> 6n*, etc.

## Why do I want to do this?

For fun! :)
