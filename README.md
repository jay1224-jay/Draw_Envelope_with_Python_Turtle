# The Research of Evenlope with Python & Python Turtle

**NOTE: This project is for Taiwan Academic Portfolio / E-Portfolio. Please do not crib it.**


## What is **"Evenlope"** in Math?

Use some tangent lines to illustrate the shape which is depended on what the pattern you use.
For example, if the pattern is *n -> 2n*, then you will get the heart shape.

## What does this project do?

Illustrate shapes from kinds of patterns such as *n -> n^2*, *n -> 6n*, etc.

## Why do I want to do this?

For fun! :)
