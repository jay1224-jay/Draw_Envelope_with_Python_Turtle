# Workflow for automation

files: 

```main.py```:            control all programs

```draw.py```:            draw Envelope by given pattern, such as n -> n^2 , n -> 2n

```image_process.py```:   process image program. get Turtle screenshot, convert .eps to .png.

## 1. Setting patterns (in ```main.py```)
Tell Python what pattern to draw

## 2. Drawing (in ```main.py```, ```draw.py```)
```main.py``` will tell ```draw.py``` what pattern to draw.

## 3. Processing image from Turtle (in ```main.py```, ```image_process.py```)
After ```draw.py``` completes, ```main.py

After ```draw.py``` completes, ```main.py``` will tell ```draw.py``` what to draw next.
